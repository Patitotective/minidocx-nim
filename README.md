# minidocx-nim
Low-level minidocx bindings for Nim.

## Installation
```
nimble install https://github.com/Patitotective/minidocx-nim/
```
[minidocx](https://github.com/totravel/minidocx) is installed as a submodule along the bindings.
In the future when high-level bindings are done, I plan to upload this library to the nimble directory.

## Bindings
The bindings were generated by c2nim and most of the procedures are untested.

If you want to see some examples, look into the examples folder.
